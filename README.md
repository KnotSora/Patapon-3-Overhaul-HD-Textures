## ðŸŽ¯ Installation:
### *It is highly recommended to download Patapon 3 HD textures before installing these.*
### You can download them here: 
- [HD textures by LinZL and Others](https://github.com/Lin-zl522/Patapon-3-HD-Texture-Pack)
### To make these textures work:
- Create a folder called "UCES01422" (skip this step if you already have such a folder)
- Place both the "Overhaul" folder and your unpacked textures of choice inside the "UCES01422" folder
- Open both "Config.ini" and "textures.ini" files with your text editor of choice and follow the instructions inside of the "Config.ini" file
- Make sure to enable Texture Replacement in the PPSSPP dev menu (Settings->Tools->Developer Tools)
- Enjoy :)
- If you're having trouble with installing you can check out a video guide [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dma6807XnzQ)
### If you're updating the textures, replace the entire "Overhaul" Folder and replace the old hashes inside of your textures.ini.
